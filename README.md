# Quantum_computing_Qiskit

Quantum computing is a fascinating concept in the science and technology industry. There’s a huge scope to use quantum computing in daily business processes in the future. 
We’ll discuss quantum computing concepts and see how it’s implemented using Python.

# An Introduction to Quantum Computing

The term ‘Quantum’ comes from Quantum Mechanics, which is the study of the physical properties of the nature of electrons and photons in physics. 
It is a framework to describe and understand the complexities of nature. Quantum computing is the process of using quantum mechanics to solve highly complicated problems.
We use classic computing to solve problems that are difficult for humans to solve. Now, we use quantum computing to solve problems that classic computing cannot solve. 
Quantum computing works on a huge volume of complex data in quick time.

# Quantum Computing Libraries available:

This repo is implemented from the official documentation provided on the Qiskit, I have implemented the QNN for image classification.

# Dataset Used for Image classification:

I have used the MNIST Dataset

To run this repo, please follow the instructions given below:
1. Install python version 3.8 
2. Install the requirement.txt file using the pip install -r requirement.txt command in the pipeline.
3. Run the quantum_computing_image_classification.py file
